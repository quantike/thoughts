Howdy, I'm Ike.

Some things about me:
- I love to solve challenging problems from first principles.
- I am fascinated by programming topics like databases, distributed systems, and machine learning.
- I enjoy using vim and ricing my terminal (see my [dotfiles](https://github.com/quantike/dotfiles)).
- My background is in physics, nuclear engineering, and high-performance computing.
