## Terminal

{{ collection(file="terminal.toml") }}

## Editor

I use Vim, btw.

I like to keep a simple Neovim configuration. My focus is on fast start up times, and relying on built-in Vim motions when possible. You can refer to my public Neovim confing [here](https://github.com/quantike/dotfiles/tree/main/nvim).

## AI Coding

I am wading into AI-assisted coding. I have been using [opencode](http://opencode.ai/), from the incredible team at [Anomaly](https://x.com/anomalyco). It touts itself as "the AI coding agent built for the terminal." It's fundamentally changed how I interact with software.

## CLI Tools

{{ collection(file="cli.toml") }}
