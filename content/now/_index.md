## Work

Currently working at [GetReal Security](https://www.getrealsecurity.com/) as an ML & Data engineer, focused on:

- Scaling ML serving for real-time deepfake detection across all major video conferencing platforms
- Building data pipelines for training first-of-their-kind video, audio, and image deepfake detectors.
- Working on PostgreSQL & S3 with my favorite languages: Python and Rust.

## Learning

Right now I'm diving deep into:

- DuckDB's novel datalake format [Ducklake](ducklake.select)
- Vector encryption and security patterns.
- Automating more of my personal fincancial workflows.

## Projects

Active side projects:

- N/A: Startups are all-consuming.

## Reading

Currently reading and exploring topics in:

- [Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption](https://ia.cr/2021/1666)
- [Scaling HNSWs](https://antirez.com/news/156)
- [What you NEED to Know Before Touching a Video File](https://gist.github.com/arch1t3cht/b5b9552633567fa7658deee5aec60453/)

## Writing

Planning to write more about:

- Nerdy things like media compression, vector encryption, and datalakes.
- Managing data pipelines for non-rectangular datasets (image, audio, video)
- Developer tooling and terminal workflows
